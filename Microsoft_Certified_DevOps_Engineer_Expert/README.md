  * Using a versioning control system
  * Centralized Version Control System
  * Distributed Version Control System
  * Benefits of each version control system
* **Using a versioning control system:-**
  * Developers can use a versioning control system to record changes that are made to their source code file over time
  * This gives the developer the ability to revert back to a previous file version or even back to a previous project version
  * The source code versioning system also has the ability to compare changes made to a file from one version to another
  * The most popular source code system is git 
* **Using a centralized source control system:-**
  * It's beneficial to use when you have a large code base 
  * Here you can specify fine grain permission at the file level
  * You can monitor the usages of files because the check-in and check-out happens at the server level
  * You can also lock files if required. This would prevent these files from being changed on server 
  * Eg:- Team Foundatiot
* **Using a distributed source control system:-**
  * You are giving the developer full control over the repository by allowing to use a local copy
  * The developer also gets the full history along with the repository code
  * It's great to use when you have many distributed teams
  * Great when working with open source code bases
  * Eg:- git

## Day-25:-

### Azure Repos- Git Branches:-
* **What we have to learn:-**
  * What are branch in Git
  * How to work with branches in Git
* What are Branches in Git:-
  * Branches help developer to work on a different line of development and not touch the main branch of work
  * So let's say that developers want to work on a new feature of an application 
  * Instead of adding the code changes to the main branch, they can create a new branch and add the code to the new branch
  * The git branches are very light weight and hence easy to use
  * Use 'git branch branch_name' command to create a new branch
  * Use 'git checkout branch_name' to make changes on new branch not the master
  * To check on which branch pointer is pointing use git branch command 

## Day-26:-

### Azure Repos - Pull requests:-
* **What we have to learn:-**
  * What are pull requests in Git

  * Let's say a developer has gone ahead and made chages to a particular branch in their local repository, and now the developer wants to merge the changes onto the branch into Azure Repos
  * Let's say that the company want to insure that the changes are viewed before they can be finally merged onto the repository in Azure repos
  * For this there can be restriction placed on the branch where in the developer first needs to intitiate a pull request
  * The pull request can be reviewed by a lead developer 
  * The lead developer can check what are the chages that are going to be made
  * If the change are approved, the pull request can be approved
  * You can protect your branches with the help of branch policies
* The different type of merges:-

## Day-35:-
### What is Azure Pipeline
* **What we have to cover**
  * What are Azure pipelines
  * The different parts of Azure pipeline

* What are Azure pipelines:-
  * This is a cloud service that can be used to automatically build and test your code projects. 
  * You can implement both continious integration and continious delivery for your application using Azure pipeline
  * Azure Pipelines can be used with a variety of programming languages include Python, Java, Javascript, PHP, Ruby, C#, c++, and Go.
  * It integrate with a variety of version control system such as GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, Azure Repos, Git & TFVC, Bitbucket cloud and subversion.
  * The defination of pipeline can be done via the classic editor or via a YAML file
  * By default the YAML file is azure-pipeline,yaml file and the file is versioned along with your code
  * We will be working with the YAML file for building and pipeline

* The different part of Azure Pipeline:-
  * **Trigger:-** This instruct the pipeline to run
  * **Stage:-** This is a way of organizating the job in the pipeline
  * A job can have one or more steps
  * Each step can be a task or a script. This is the smallest block of the pipeline

### Azure Pipeline- Triggering a build:-
* An Azure pipleline is a part of CI hence if we do some changes to the code and then commit it then Azure pipeline is automatically go to trigger build for the same.
