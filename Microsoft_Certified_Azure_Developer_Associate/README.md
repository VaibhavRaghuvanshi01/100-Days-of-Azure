# Day-1:-

## Skills measured during the exam :-
* Develop Azure compute solutions
* Develop for Azure storage
* Implement Azure security
* Monitor, troubleshoot, and optimize Azure solutions
* Connect to and consume Azure services and third-party services

## Azure Overview
* Compute
* Devops 
* Storage
* Networking
* Analytics
* Integration

But for most of the application we need three core elements:-
* Compute
* Storage
* Networking

## Compute
Compute contain :-
* Azure VMs
* Azure App Service
* Azure Container Instances
* Azure Kubernetes Service
* Azure functions
 
## Storage
* Azure Blob Storage
* Azure File Storage
* Azure Data Lake Storage
* Azure SQL Database
* Azure DB for Open Source
* Azure Synapse Analytics
* Azure Cosmos DB
* Azure Cache for Redis
* Azure Cosmos DB

## Networking 
* Vnet
* Subnets
* Vnet Perring
* Azure VPN
* Azure Express
* Route

we will cover the above topics in depth in the upcoming days. 


# Day-2:-

# Service Categories

## Migration
i. Azure Migrate:-
   * It discovers your on-premises servers, both physical and virtual.
   * Then it assesses these machines.
   * For each one, it tells you whether or not it's ready to migrate, how big the Azure VM will be, how much it will cost, and any dependent servers that will also need to be migrated. When you're ready, it will even help you do the migration.

ii. Azure Active Directory
   * This is a managed identity service that takes care of authentication.
   * there are many options for synchronizing your on-premises directory with your Azure directory.

## DevOps

i. Azure DevOps
   * It helps you to  automate large portions of the building, testing, and releasing of application updates.

ii. Azure Pipelines
   * It lets you create automated workflows to continuously build, test, and deploy code.

iii. Azure DevTest Labs
   *  It makes you easy to spin up non-production environments. You could do this in other ways, but DevTest Labs gives you some extra capabilities, such as allowing administrators to control costs by setting limits on how many VMs can be deployed at once and ensuring that VMs are shut down when they're not in use.
   
iv. Azure Content Delivery Network
   * which lets you take advantage of Microsoft's extensive global network. 
   *  It caches your most frequently accessed content in locations around the world so your end-users will retrieve it from the closest point on the network. This really helps with making your web applications feel more like local applications.

## Internet of Things
i. Azure IoT Central
  * It is a fully managed SaaS solution that takes care of the technical details for you. It lets you create IoT applications without writing any code. 

ii. Azure IoT Hub

 * It's a service that handles secure communications with thousands, or even millions, of IoT devices. In fact, it's the service that IoT Central uses behind the scenes.

iii. Azure Sphere 

 * It make your IoT devices more secure.
 * It includes certified chips, the Azure Sphere operating system, and the Azure Sphere Security Service, all of which provide layers of protection for your IoT devices.

##  Analytics
i. Azure HDInsight
 * It supports a wide variety of open-source big data frameworks, including Hadoop, Spark, Hive, Storm, and many others.

ii. Azure Databricks 
 * It is a similar service because it runs Spark as well, but it's more user-friendly and easier to manage than HDInsight.
 
iii. Azure Synapse Analytics
 * It is the new version of Azure SQL Data Warehouse. It includes all of the old data warehouse functionality, but it also supports Spark analytics. 

## Artificial Intelligence 
 
i. Azure Cognitive Services
 * This is a collection of pre-built artificial intelligence tools. These services let you add AI capabilities to applications even if you don't know anything about machine learning.

ii.  Azure Bot Service
 * It gives you the tools to create a chatbot. This is an intelligent agent that can answer questions. For example, you could create a chatbot to handle simple support requests from customers.

iii. Azure Machine Learning Studio
 * It lets you train and deploy machine learning models without any coding, using a drag-and-drop interface. I highly recommend it for learning the basics of machine learning. 

iv. Azure Machine Learning Services
 * It gives you full control over every stage of the machine learning process. 
 * You can use any Python-based machine learning framework, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch, train models using services such as Azure Databricks, and deploy models using services such as Azure Kubernetes Service.
 * Azure Machine Learning Services is usually the best solution when you need to build your own custom artificial intelligence application.

## Integration Tools
i. Azure Logic Apps
 * It lets you automate this sort of task without writing any code. 
 * You can create a logic app using a drag-and-drop interface. 

ii. Azure Event Grid
 * It is use to notify your logic app of particular event.
 * For example, if you want to get an email every time a virtual machine is created in a subscription, then you would configure Event Grid to send a message to your logic app whenever this occurs.


## DAY:-3

# Managing Services

i. Azure Monitor 
 * It's a collection of a variety of monitoring tools. 
 * the core features of Azure Monitor are metrics and alerts.
 * Metrics are basically statistics on various aspects of your resources, such as CPU usage on virtual machines and space used on Blob Storage.
 * It can also watch critical metrics you specify and send you an alert if there's a problem. 

ii. Azure Backup
 * Azure VMs are a little different because you back them up using a service called Azure Backup. 
 * you can even use this service to back up your on-premises systems.

iii.  Azure Advisor
 * It will not only suggest ways to improve the performance and availability of your applications, but it will even suggest ways to reduce your costs.
 * Azure Advisor also provides security recommendations.
